budget
===============================================================================

A simple command-line budget tool to keep track of expenses, past and future.  
It uses [ledger][1] as a backend.  The main added feature of `budget` is to 
"predict" the future expenses based on past expenses (and other information).

One additional feature of `budget` is to tag expenses.  This allows you to mark 
your expenses for e.g. generating the correct sums when doing taxes.
